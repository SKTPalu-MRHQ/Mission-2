# Mission-2

This is my Mission 2 repo.

I'll put all the details in a separate .txt file, I'll update the README when I've done some dev work

This is a simple website that I've created that accepts data input by the user and uses it to calculate the other values.

Quick spiel:

The 5th Edition of Dungeons and Dragons is often shortened to DnD 5e. This is the ruleset that I used to make this website.

You enter in the 7 main stats: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, Level.

These are used to calculate all other scores.
