For Mission 2, there are 2 ideas I got.

    - Update my CV website (I think it's trash so might just change it and finish it in my own time)
    - Create a character creator for 5e dnd; I can use Javascript for the calculations and printing the page


I'm going with the second one; I'll work on the first one another time.

We'll go barebones for this; just the front page with stats

Okay, let's get started with the numbers

Base Numbers:
    Stats ~ STR DEX CON INT WIS CHA
    Level
    Weight
    HP


Calculated Numbers:
    Stat Modifiers: (Stat - 10)/2 rounded down (can be positive or negative)
        e.g. STR = 19 so STR Mod = (19 - 10)/2 = 4.5 = +4
        OR CHA = 5 so CHA Mod = (5 - 10)/2 = -2.5 = -3
    
    Proficiency: Switch cases (Proficiency doesn't scale linearly with level (generally))
        1 - 4 = +2
        5 - 8 = +3
        9 - 12 = +4
        13 - 16 = +5
        17 - 20 = +6

        Hopefully Switch cases can take inequalities, otherwise I'll have 20 switch cases
    
    AC: 10 + DEX Mod + Shield Bonus
        Optional: give an option to change what you put here in AC
    
    Saving Throws: Stat Mod + Proficiency

    Skills: Stat Mod + Proficiency
        Optional: Expertise(Proficiency bonus doubled) and Jack of All Trades(not proficient = + Proficiency/2)
    
    Passive Perception: Perception Skill + 10

    Tool Proficiencies: Relevant Stat Mod + Proficiency

    To hit Bonuses: Proficiency + Relevant Stat Mod

    Damage Bonuses: Proficiency + Relevant Stat Mod
    
Other things:
    Text boxes to hold Class Feats
    Equipment
    Personality Traits
    Ideals
    Bonds
    Flaws
